This is where specific level files are kept.  They will be convention be named "l<level number>".
For example, level 20 would be "l20" with a lower case l followed by 20 and no space.

We plan on having 30 default levels for now; players will be able to construct their own levels.
Levels will go from 1 being the easiest to 30 being the trickiest.
