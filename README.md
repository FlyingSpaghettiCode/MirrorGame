# MirrorGame

Work on: a level creator, collisions, standard and menu levels.  Player Tree also needs to be worked on.

Add: sounds and graphics

Adriano is working on level writers/readers.

Edgar is working on cleaning up.


To run just put Mirror games in eclipse and run it.  It should work if you are running a finished build.
If you are too dank for eclipse and prefer to run from the command line like praveen args.txt can be helpful.
