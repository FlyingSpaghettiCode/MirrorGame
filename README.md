# MirrorGame ReaderWriter

Work on: a level creator, collisions, standard and menu levels.  Player Tree also needs to be worked on.

Add: sounds and graphics

Adriano is working on level writers/readers.

Edgar is working on cleaning up.


To run just put Mirror games in eclipse and run it.  It should work if you are running a finished build.
If you are too dank for eclipse and prefer to run from the command line like praveen args.txt can be helpful.
This is a branch that can create levels from text files and write to text files.
It will store it in a folder in documents, which you can create manually or by running the bat file
in our repo.  You can also store it in the src folder if you prefer.
