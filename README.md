# MirrorGame

Work on: a level creator, collisions, standard and menu levels.  Player Tree also needs to be worked on.

Add: sounds and graphics

Adriano is working on level writers/readers.

Patrick is working on collisions, player trees and movements, and screen scaling.
  (I need some help figuring out why the scaling is imperfect)

Edgar is working on cleaning up.


To run just put Mirror games in eclipse and run it.  It should work if you are running a finished build.
If you are too dank for eclipse and prefer to run from the command line like praveen args.txt can be helpful.
